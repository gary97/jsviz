JSViz is best suited for projects that:
   * Need dynamic layouts, based on connected graphs
   * Demand Fast load time, even for first-time visitors
   * Require Support for SVG or HTML elements
   * Prefer to integrate with a JavaScript implementation.
   * Have low graph scalability requirements (maximum 100-200 nodes/graph)

If your project has different requirements, you may consider any of these alternative projects:
