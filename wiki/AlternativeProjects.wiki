JSViz is best suited for projects that:
   * Require dynamic layouts, based on connected graphs
   * Demand fast load time, even for first-time visitors
   * Require support for graph nodes implemented as SVG or HTML elements
   * Prefer to integrate with a JavaScript implementation
   * Have low graph scalability requirements (around 100-200 nodes/graph)
