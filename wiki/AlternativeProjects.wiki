#summary A listing of alternative projects.

JSViz is best suited for projects that:
   * Require dynamic layouts, based on connected graphs
   * Demand fast load time, even for first-time visitors
   * Require support for graph nodes implemented as SVG or HTML elements
   * Prefer to integrate with a JavaScript implementation
   * Have low graph scalability requirements (around 100-200 nodes/graph)

If your project has different requirements, you may consider any of these alternative projects:

|| *Project* || *License* || Description ||
|| [http://www.processing.org/ Processing] || open || An environment for creating dynamic images and animations. Products can be displayed as a Java Applet ||
|| [http://www.thinkmap.com/ ThinkMap] || commercial || Provides an SDK for generating dyanmic connected graph visualizations. ||
|| [http://www.graphviz.org/ GraphViz] || open || An application for generating static connected graph visualizations. ||
|| [http://www.touchgraph.com/ TouchGraph] || commercial || Another Applet based animated connected graph solution. ||
|| [http://www.mxgraph.com/ MxGraph] || commercial / open || VML/SVG cross browser diagramming solution by the JGraph team, stronger on graph edition, weaker on layouts ||
|| [http://wiki.visualmodeller.org/ JgraphpadCe] || open / commercial || Applet diagram editor using JGraph. The applet is preloaded in the background and communicates with the browser with liveconnect. Heavier solution than jsviz but stronger on diagram edition. ||
